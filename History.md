## v0.1.3 - April 22, 2014

 * Add documentation and examples.

 * Support `nav: '.selector'` to keep the nav bar between sliding screens.

 * Fix bug where going back on a modal screen while it's animating will produce 
 unexpected results.

 * Allow passing a custom transition to a pane via `.push(name, { transition: 
   'modal' }, fn)`.

## v0.1.2 - April 4, 2014

 * Allow `.push(name)` without a function to switch to previously-defined panes.  
 This makes `.go()` deprecated.

 * Purge obsolete panes.

 * Prevent scrolling during transitions.

First official release.

 * Added explicit support for Ractive, React.js and Backbone.js.
 * Refactored `.push()` - elements are now generated by their respective panes.
 * Updated animations to match iOS7 better.

## v0.1.0 - Prerelease
