Navstack
========

Manage a stack of multiple views. Perfect for tabs, navigation stacks, and 
similar.  Inspired by iOS's UINavigationController.

 * __Framework-agnostic__: made to play fair with [Backbone], [Ractive], 
 [React.js] and more. Can even work with plain old jQuery.

 * __Router-friendly__: made to be able to work with pushstate routers (like 
     [page.js]).

 * __Mobile-like transitions__: buttery-smooth transitions are available out of 
 the box, modeled after iOS7.

Requires jQuery 1.7+.

(__Status:__ *very usable, but lacking documentation and examples. API is not 
 fully stable yet. Will get to that eventually!*)

Install
-------

Navstack is a JS + CSS bundle.

 * [navstack.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstacruz/navstack/master/navstack.js)
 * [navstack.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstacruz/navstack/master/navstack.css)

Or get it via Bower:

    bower install navstack

Then use it:

``` html
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="navstack.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="navstack.css">
```

Usage
-----

### Basic usage

Use `.push()` to create your panes. Pass a callback that will return a 
[Backbone] view, [Ractive] or [React.js] instance, or a DOM element.

``` js
stage = new Navstack({ el: '#stage' });

// Navigate to new pages using push.
stage.push('home', function() {
  return $("<div class='full-screen'>This is the home screen</div>");
});

// The first parameter is an ID for the pane to be pushed
stage.push('task:1', function() {
  return $("<div class='full-screen'>Task #1 details: ...</div>");
});

// You may use Backbone, Ractive, or React.js views
stage.push('task:1', function() {
  return new Backbone.View({ ... });
});

// Switch to older panes using .go()
stage.go('home');
```

### Transitions

Include the [navstack.css](navstack.css) file and use:

``` js
stage = new Navstack({
  transition: 'slide'
})
```

Available transitions are:

 * `slide`
 * `modal`
 * ...more later

### As a class

Rather than repetitively defining your constructor parameters across different 
instances, you can subclass `Navstack` using `Navstack.extend`. This allows you 
to set preset parameters, as well as define your own methods.

``` js
Stage = Navstack.extend({
  /* options go here */
});

stage = new Stage({ el: '#stage' });
stage.go('home');
```

### Tabs

You can also use it for tabs by creating your tab panes --
this tells Navstack how to construct a tab as they're needed. This allows you to 
`.go()` to any tab at any time.

``` js
// Define your panes under the `panes` key
stage = new Navstack({
  el: '#stage',
  panes: {
    home: function() {
      return $("<div class='full-screen'>This is the home screen</div>")el: };
    },
    messages: function() {
      return $("<div class='full-screen'>Messages: ...</div>");
    }
  }
});

// Switch to a pane
stage.go('home');
stage.go('messages');
```

Cheat sheet
-----------

``` js
stage = Navstack.extend({
  panes: { ... },
  transition: ...
});

stage.go('page');

stage.push('pane_id', function () {
  return $("<div>...</div>";
  return new Ractive(...);
  return new ReactComponent(...);
});

// Access the active pane
stage.active;
stage.active.el;    //=> <div>
stage.active.view;  //=> whatever's returned in the initializer
stage.active.name;  //=> "home"

// Access the stack
stage.stack;
stage.stack['pane_id'].view;
stage.stackLength()
```
